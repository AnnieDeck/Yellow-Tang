# Succession of the Yellow Tang (Zebrasoma flavescens) Microbiome from Hatch to Settlement in a Recirculating Aquaculture System
This repository contains code and data for my master's thesis project at Hawai ªi Pacific University under the advisement of Dr. Olivia Nigro. Data was collected from yellow tang reared in the Doherty Hatchery at the Oceanic Institute from June 1-August 13, 2023. Using a 16S rRNA gene high throughput sequencing approach, the taxonomic composition of bacteria and archaea were assessed from the larval yellow tang, their diet, and their recirculating rearing water at eight key developmental timepoints from 2-76 days post-hatch. The purpose of this study was to investigate larval microbiome changes through early development and how the microbial landscape of their diet and rearing water modulates this assembly over time.
